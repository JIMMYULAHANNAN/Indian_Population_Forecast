Introduction

Population forecasting is a crucial task for policymakers, economists, and researchers as it helps in planning for resource allocation, infrastructure development, and economic strategies. This project aims to predict the future population of India using a dataset and statistical modeling. The implemented Python code follows a structured approach involving data preprocessing, visualization, model selection, and prediction.

Data Collection and Preprocessing

The first step involves importing the necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, and matplotlib. The dataset containing historical population records of India is loaded into a pandas DataFrame. Basic data preprocessing techniques are applied, including handling missing values and ensuring the data format is suitable for analysis. The dataset is then explored to understand trends and patterns in population growth.

Data Visualization

To gain insights into historical population trends, various visualizations such as line plots and scatter plots are created using Matplotlib and Seaborn. These visualizations help in understanding the growth trajectory and any anomalies present in the data.

Model Selection and Training

For population forecasting, regression models such as Linear Regression are employed. The dataset is split into training and testing subsets to evaluate the performance of the model. The selected model is trained using historical data, where the independent variable is time (years), and the dependent variable is the population.

Prediction and Evaluation

Once the model is trained, it is used to make predictions on future years. The accuracy of the model is assessed using performance metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE). These metrics help determine the effectiveness of the model in capturing population trends.

Future Population Projection

After evaluating the model's performance, future population projections are made for upcoming years. The forecasted values are visualized using graphs to present a clear picture of Indiaâ€™s expected population growth.

Conclusion

The project provides an effective approach to predicting India's population using statistical techniques. By leveraging historical data and machine learning models, the forecast can assist in decision-making for various governmental and economic policies. The accuracy of the predictions depends on the quality of the dataset and the effectiveness of the chosen model. Future enhancements can involve incorporating more complex models such as time series forecasting techniques (ARIMA, LSTM) for better accuracy.
